A powerful, AI-driven application that automatically analyzes and shortlists resumes for AI engineering positions using Azure OpenAI's GPT models.

## üìã Overview

Resume Shortlister processes hundreds of PDF resumes, extracting structured information and using a sophisticated evaluation framework to rank candidates according to technical expertise, project complexity, work ethic, and other relevant factors. Save countless hours of manual resume screening with intelligent, consistent analysis.

### Key Features

- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles 250+ resumes, with optimized performance for large datasets
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Extracts structured data (name, contact details, education, experience) from PDFs
- **Custom Evaluation Weights**: Configure your own weights for different evaluation criteria
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed Markdown reports with executive summary and individual evaluations
- **Web Interface**: Optional FastAPI web application for interactive usage
- **Custom Job Descriptions**: Adapt the evaluation framework to any role with your own job description

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- Azure OpenAI API credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-shortlister.git
cd resume-shortlister
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv resume
source resume/bin/activate  # On Windows: resume\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Azure OpenAI credentials:
```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o  # or your specific deployment name
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview  # or current version
```

## üíª Usage

### Command Line Interface

The simplest way to run Resume Shortlister is with the CLI:

```bash
# Basic usage with default settings
python run_shortlister.py /path/to/resume/pdfs

# Specify output file
python run_shortlister.py /path/to/resume/pdfs -o shortlisted_candidates.md

# Custom evaluation weights
python run_shortlister.py /path/to/resume/pdfs -w "technical_expertise:0.4,project_complexity:0.3,work_ethic:0.15,hackathon_experience:0.05,extracurricular:0.05,certifications:0.05"

# Provide custom job description (either file path or direct text)
python run_shortlister.py /path/to/resume/pdfs -j "job_description.txt"
# OR
python run_shortlister.py /path/to/resume/pdfs -j "We are looking for an AI Engineer with..."

# Control parallel processing threads
python run_shortlister.py /path/to/resume/pdfs -t 8
```

### Web Interface

For a more interactive experience, you can run the web application:

```bash
cd app
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## üìù Evaluation Framework

Shortlisting is based on the following criteria:

| Criterion | Default Weight | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Technical Expertise | 35% | NLP, LLM concepts, Python, web frameworks |
| Project Complexity | 25% | Sophistication, technologies used, results |
| Hackathon Experience | 10% | Participation and outcomes |
| Work Ethic | 15% | Self-motivation, initiative, consistent delivery |
| Extracurricular Activities | 10% | Competitions, open-source, communities |
| Certifications | 5% | Relevant technical certifications |

The evaluation criteria can be customized by:
1. Providing custom weights with the `-w` parameter
2. Providing a custom job description with the `-j` parameter, which will adapt the evaluation framework to the specific role requirements

## üìä Output Format

The generated Markdown report includes:

1. **Executive Summary**:
   - Overall statistics (number of candidates, score distribution)
   - Average scores across all categories
   - Top 10 candidates with key strengths

2. **Detailed Candidate Evaluations**:
   - Contact information (name, email, GitHub, LinkedIn)
   - Scores for each evaluation criterion
   - Technical assessment in bullet points
   - Project complexity rating with details
   - Other criterion-specific details
   - Overall remarks

3. **Contact Information Table**:
   - Summary table with all candidate contact details for easy reference

## üîß Advanced Features

### Custom Job Descriptions

The system can adapt to different hiring needs by analyzing a provided job description. When you pass a job description with the `-j` parameter, the system:

1. Extracts key technical skills, requirements, and responsibilities
2. Creates a custom evaluation framework tailored to the specific role
3. Evaluates candidates based on this customized framework

This makes the tool flexible for hiring across different positions and departments.

### Smart Resume Parsing

The system uses multiple extraction techniques to handle various PDF formats:

1. Primary extraction with PDFPlumber
2. Fallback extraction with PyPDFium2 if the primary extraction fails
3. Structured information extraction for contact details, education, experience, etc.

### Intelligent Batching

For large resume collections, the system:

1. Organizes resumes into optimal batches based on size
2. Processes batches in parallel with adjustable thread count
3. Implements dynamic rate limiting to prevent API throttling

## üîß Customization

### Evaluation Weights

Modify the weights in `app/llm_shortlister.py` or pass custom weights via command line:

```python
EVAL_WEIGHTS = {
    "technical_expertise": 0.35,
    "project_complexity": 0.25,
    "hackathon_experience": 0.10,
    "work_ethic": 0.15,
    "extracurricular": 0.10,
    "certifications": 0.05
}
```

### Prompt Customization

The evaluation framework prompt can be customized in `app/llm_shortlister.py`.
