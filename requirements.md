You are expert python and LLM developer. 
You primary task is to develop a application that will use advance LLM techniques to shortlist candidates for a AI egineering intern position. 

There are 200+ resumes at the ''/Users/itscodezero/Documents/NeuDayAI/Hiring/VIIT Internships 2025/NeuDayAI   _ Upload resume (File responses)' location on filesytem.

Use following Evaludation framework as guide for candidate shortlisting. 

----------
Evaluation Framework for AI Engineering Intern Candidates
The ideal candidate for your AI Engineering internship position should demonstrate capabilities in NLP, LLM concepts, Python programming, and web framework experience (FastAPI/Flask). Based on your requirements, here's what to look for when reviewing actual candidate applications:

Technical Expertise Indicators
Strong candidates should showcase projects and experience with:

Natural Language Processing implementations

LLM applications including RAG systems

Vector database experience

Chatbot development

Python programming with web frameworks

Prompt engineering techniques

Project Complexity Assessment
When evaluating projects on resumes, look for:

Implementation of sophisticated AI models

Projects involving multiple technologies (Python, APIs, databases)

Projects with quantifiable results

Clear explanation of technical challenges overcome

For example, one resume excerpt stated: "Contributed to a cutting-edge project focusing on the enhancement of depth estimation techniques, increasing model accuracy by 15%". This demonstrates both technical expertise and quantifiable results.

Hackathon Participation
The search results highlight the importance of hackathon experience:

"Participated in hackathons, developing solutions for data-driven challenges faced by non-profits in San Diego area"

Projects that solve real-world problems indicate practical application skills

Work Ethic and Passion Indicators
Look for resumes that demonstrate:

Consistent project completion

Multiple self-initiated projects

Evidence of learning new technologies independently

Progressive skill development over time

For example, a strong candidate might show: "Innovative AI enthusiast with a robust academic background and practical hands-on projects in machine learning, computer vision, and robotics", indicating passion and self-motivation.

Extracurricular Activities
Valuable extracurricular activities include:

Participation in AI/ML competitions

Open-source contributions

Technical communities membership

Leadership in tech-related clubs or groups

Relevant Certifications
Based on the search results, look for certifications in:

Machine Learning/AI specializations

Python programming

Cloud platforms (AWS/GCP) with ML focus

Data Science foundations

Example Project Evaluation
One particularly relevant project mentioned is the "Resume Analyzer using LLMs":

"To build a Resume Analyzer using LLMs, first, preprocess the resumes to extract text. Then, fine-tune the LLM, such as BERT, on a dataset containing labeled resumes for various job categories. Utilize prompt engineering to guide the model in understanding and analyzing resume content."

This project demonstrates several desired skills:

LLM fine-tuning

Prompt engineering

Classification techniques

Information extraction

User interface development
